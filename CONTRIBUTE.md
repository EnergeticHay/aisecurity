# Contributing Guide
This repository uses GitHub's pull-request system for contributors, but before you submit your pull request, there are a few things you should do.
1. New files should follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
2. Use `black` in order to automatically clean up your code - `pip install black` `black .`
3. Do not leave your debug print statements in your pull request
4. Avoid duplication of existing code
